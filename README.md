## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jordan, an accounting graduate looking to learn more about the world of data science.

I am currently a freelance business analyst that primarily support content creators and people in my community through data-driven decisions. However, I am looking for a fulltime position within this space as I would like to develop my professional skillset.

Outside of work, I am interested in art(movies, video games, visual, music), sports, and keeping up in the world of tech/science. 

Let's connect!
