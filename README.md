## Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/youruserid/imagename.png" alt="Hi image" style="height:24px;">


I'm Jordan, an accounting graduate exploring the world of data analytics.

Currently I work as a freelance business analyst, primarily supporting content creators and members of my community by helping them make data-driven decisions. I am now seeking full-time opportunities that allow me to develop my analytics skills in a professional setting.

Outside of work, I am passionate about art in all its forms(mainly movies, music, and video games), sports, and keeping up in the world of tech/science. 

Let's connect!
