## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jordan, an accounting graduate exploring the world of data analytics.

Currently I work as a freelance business analyst, primarily supporting content creators and members of my community by helping them make data-driven decisions. I am now seeking full-time opportunities within this space as I would like to develop my professional skillset.

Outside of work, I am passionate about art in all its forms(mainly movies, music, and video games), sports, and keeping up in the world of tech/science. 

Let's connect!
